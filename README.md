# An-In-Depth-Exploration-of-Hotel-Data-Using-SQL
Using SQL, I will explore hotel data to highlight some key findings. These insights will help us get a better understanding of booking patterns, customer behaviour, revenue optimization and cancellation patterns.

## Background of the ProjectÂ 
This project was posted as a challenge by Splendor on X (formerly Twitter) for beginners and advanced analysts as a learning exercise. I used MySQL on visual studio for the data cleaning and exploration.

## Key Insights
1. High number of cancellations resulted in high revenue loss. SHG Hotel should explore how to minimize cancellations. A way to do this would be to ask customers to confirm reason of cancellation.
2. High lead times had the highest number of cancellations. A way to minimize this would be to increase the average daily rate for lead times above 91 days and change the deposit type to non-refundable
3. More staff should be deployed to work on Mondays as it has the most number of checkins and checkouts and less staff should work on Tuesdays as it has the least number of checkins and checkouts. This will help ensure a smooth process and customer satisfaction.
4. Transient customers had the most number of cancellations. The majority who cancelled chose the no-deposit option when booking. A good number also chose the non-refundable option but still cancelled, this should be looked into further.
